## Your choice of game
I chose a **Quiz Game**.
It’s a simple game where players answer questions, test their knowledge, and earn points. 

## Pseudcode
When you start a game ther will be a **WELCOME** 
Message.
Game will have a set of quiz question whit multiple possible answers.
>> For each question in the quiz:
* Show the question and the possible answers.
* Check if the answer is valid.
* If the answer is correct, increase the score and let the player know.
* If the answer is wrong, show the correct answer.

>>After all questions are answered, show the player their final score.

>>Give some feedback based on performance (for example: “Great job!” with confeti or “Try again to improve your score”).

>>End the game, with the option to restart if you want.

#### Below, I will include images showing how I imagined the game’s design.
